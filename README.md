## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the motion of a football by modelling forces such as gravity, drag and spin, and numerically integrating motion equations to compute position, velocity and energy over time. It showcases:

- Object-oriented design with C++ classes representing players and simulation entities  
- Numerical methods including finite differences and 4th-order Runge–Kutta integration  
- Quantitative data processing for motion analysis

This repository is intended to demonstrate structured modelling and numerical computing skills in a reproducible and extendable form.
